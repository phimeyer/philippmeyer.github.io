Here you can find information on my submitted papers, recent projects and working paper.

I am particularly interested in research on Comparative Political Institutions and Quantitative Text Analysis with an emphasis on Judicial Politics, Judicial Public Relations and Political Communication. Currently I am particular interested in when and how the German Federal Constitutional Court uses public relations in order to set frames and influence media coverage and the public.
 
<b>Under Review</b>
 
 - Meyer, Philipp. Understanding intra-institutional agenda-setting effects: An assessment of the two policy agendas at the German Federal Constitutional Court.
