I am a Research Associate, Teaching Fellow and PhD Student in the Department of Political Science at Leibniz University Hannover, Germany. I earned a bachelor degree in Political Science and History form the University of Greifswald and a master degree in Political Science from the University of Bamberg.

I research politics with particular interest and expertise in:
- Judicial Politics and Judicial Public Relations
- Political Communication
- Comparative Political Institutions


I am also interested in novel developments in political methodology, such as automated text analysis and various applications of big data in political research.
