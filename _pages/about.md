I am a Political Scientist and Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz University Hannover, Germany. I research politics with particular interest and expertise in:

- Judicial Politics, Judicial Behaviour, and Judicial Public Relations
- Political Communication
- Policy Agenda Dynamics
- Political Institutions

I am also interested in novel developments in methodologies, such as automated text analysis and various applications of big data in political research.
