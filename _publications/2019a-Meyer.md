<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Which institutional structures determine the publication of press releases by constitutional courts? Research has shown that courts strategically use press releases to provide information. However, less is known about how and when courts choose to publish a press release concerning a ruling. Focusing on institutional aspects this paper argues that press releases are an integral part of judicial public relations and are used for the dissemination of information to create or enhance openness within the process of adjudication and transparency surrounding court rulings. This argument is tested empirically using a novel data set on the activities of the German Federal Constitutional Court. Based on 1125 rulings decided between 1996 and 2018, this paper shows that oral hearings and proceeding types are the main factor determining the publication of court press releases as these are indices of legal conflict between lower court branches or political conflict between political institutions.</p>
