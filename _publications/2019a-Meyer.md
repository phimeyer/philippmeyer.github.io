<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Which institutional structures determine the publication of press releases by constitutional courts? Research has shown that courts use press releases to disseminate information. However, less is known about exactly when courts choose to publish a press release on a ruling. Focusing on institutional aspects this paper argues that press releases are a part of judicial public relations and are used to create or enhance openness and transparency surrounding specific court rulings. This argument is tested empirically using a novel data set on the activities of the German Federal Constitutional Court. Based on 1131 rulings decided between 1996 and 2018, this paper shows that status quo change and proceeding types are the main factors determining the publication of court press releases, while intra-judicial and internal conflict are a less likely cause of press
releases.</p>
