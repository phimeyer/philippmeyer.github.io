<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
 Policy agenda scholars have largely ignored judicial policy agendas apart from the United States Supreme Court. Especially patterns of agenda change using punctuated equilibrium theory are understudied in the case of judicial institutions. Furthermore, recent research on judicial public relations has revealed that courts around the world especially use press release to strategically promote specific decisions. In this context, this paper asks the following research question: Do public relations help courts focus their policy agenda? To address this gap the case and public relations agenda of the German Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) between 1996 and 2018 will be examined. The data for this analysis includes 6941 court cases decided by Court and 1539 decision-related press releases. As the FCC does not possess an effective docket control, its agenda is quite fragmentated. This paper argues that the Court can strategically focus its policy agenda on specific issues using press releases as a means of judicial public relations. Through semi-supervised text classification of decisions and press releases according to the coding framework provided by the Comparative Agendas Project, this paper compares the case agenda of the FCC and the Court’s public relations agenda. The analysis provides a unique overview of the Court’s case and public relations agenda and it demonstrates that judicial public relations can help courts without effective docket control to gain agenda-setting control.</p>
