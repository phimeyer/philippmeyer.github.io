<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Courts are perceived as major political institutions, however, policy research has largely ignored how courts distribute their attention across and within policy issues. Unlike the agendas of political institutions, those of courts are determined by external actors such as litigants and legislators. The ability of a court to focus its attention on policy issues depends on its docket control power. Yet, recent research has shown that courts can alternatively shape their policy agenda through the selective promotion of their decisions with press releases. Therefore, we argue that if a Court publishes press releases it automatically possess both a decision agenda and a press release agenda. But does a Court's decision agenda and its press release agenda differ?
	
Empirically, we examine the policy issues of decisions of the German Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) between 1998 and 2010 and compare them with the press releases the Court has published to promote some of these decisions. The data includes 4489 decisions and 1029 press releases. Based on a set of manually coded documents, we use supervised learning algorithms for policy issue coding. The whole data sets as well as several subsets are analyzed to assess and compare the issue diversity on both agendas. 
	
Two major results are found. First, the decision agenda is less diverse than the press release agenda. This implicates that courts use press release for agenda-setting. Second, when focusing on statute and law invalidation the agenda diversity on both agendas are nearly identical. This validates previous research regarding the strategic use of press releases by courts. </p>
