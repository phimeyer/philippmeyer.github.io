<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Courts which promote decisions with press releases possess two policy agendas: a decision and a press release agenda. Which intra-institutional dynamics can be identified and to what extent can agenda-setting effects be identified? We focus on agenda diversity to analyze the dynamics of intra-institutional agenda setting. Using supervised text classification, we code policy issues in 7114 decisions and 1579 press releases of the German Federal Constitutional Court between 1998 and 2019. We first compare both agendas according to their composition. Second, based on time series we evaluate the first-level agenda setting effects between both agendas. We do that by means of Granger-causality analysis. The results indicate that both FCC agendas possess different dynamics, since abstract reviews have the strongest effect on the decision agenda diversity and inter-branch conflicts are causing the press release agenda diversity. This implies that press releases are used by the Court to safeguard its institutional reputation.</p>
