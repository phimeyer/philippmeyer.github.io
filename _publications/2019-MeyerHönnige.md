<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Policy agenda research has ignored judicial policy agendas outside the US Supreme Court largely even though courts are perceived important institutions in comparative politics meanwhile. Unlike the agenda of political institutions, the input to court agendas are determined by external actors such as litigants and legislators. The ability of a court to explicitly shape its policy agenda depends on its docket control power. Discretionary docket control facilitates a Court's agenda-setting power, while a mandatory docket suppresses it. The policy agenda perceived by the public can implicitly be shaped through the issuing of press releases to promote certain cases and issues. Thus, this paper asks the following research question: Which factors determine the change of a courts public relations agenda from the decisions agenda? 
	We argue that the court agenda is dived into a decision agenda and a press release agenda and that the Court can focus its policy agenda on specific issues by promoting cases with press releases. Determinants are xxxx. Empirically, we examine the policy issues of the German Federal Constitutional Court (FCC) decisions and compare them with the policy issues the Court promotes through press releases. We analyse the FCC between 1998 and 2010. The data includes 4489 decisions from which 1029 are promoted by press releases.Based on a set of 1070 hand coded FCC decisions we rely on several supervised learning algorithms - ensemble coding - to carve out the policy topic for each one of the 4489 decisions. The policy topics are coded according coding scheme of the Comparative Agendas Project. Methodologically, we will focus on classical concepts and metrics of the policy agenda literature, like the punctuated equilibrium theory, kurtosis and entropy and run a regression. The analysis provides a unique overview of both agenda types and it demonstrates that judicial public relations can help courts without effective docket control to gain agenda-setting control. </p>
