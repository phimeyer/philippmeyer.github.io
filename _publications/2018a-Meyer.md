<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Media coverage affects the perceived legitimacy of the judiciary, but why does the news media report on decisions by constitutional courts? An event’s newsworthiness is argued to be the decisive reason for the media to cover it. Research on the media coverage on decisions by federal and regional courts in the U.S. shows that a decision’s newsworthiness is determined by the news values like influence, conflict, and familiarity. However, in the context of European constitutional courts, similar results do not exist. To fill this gap, this paper analyzes why decisions of the German Federal Constitutional Courts are featured in the media, defined here as receiving media coverage in at least one newspaper article. Based on of 3,404 decisions and 9,436 newspaper articles between 2008 and 2018, I use local text alignment between court cases and newspaper articles to identify media coverage. Rare events logistic regression models are conducted to determine why decisions receive media coverage. The results show that the media is more likely to report on court cases if the journalists are familiar with court decisions (through earlier held oral hearings or press releases which invite the media's attention), whereas news values like influence and conflict do not exert a substantial influence of the probability of media coverage. This implicates that courts possess institutional tools, which they can strategically use to influence media coverage.
