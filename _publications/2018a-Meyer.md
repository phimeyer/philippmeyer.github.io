<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Media coverage affects the perceived legitimacy of the judiciary, but why decisions by constitutional courts receive media coverage? Research shows that the newsworthiness of an event is the decisive reason for the media to cover it. Previous research which has analyzed the media coverage of decisions by U.S. state supreme court cases, shows that the newsworthiness of a court decision is determined by the news factors like influence, conflict and familiarity (Vining/Wilhelm 2010).

This paper examines the extent to which aspects determine whether the media covers decisions made by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Based on of 3.408 decisions and 9.436 media reports between 2008 and 2018, I use local text alignment between court cases and newspaper articles to identify media coverage. Logistic regression models are conducted to determine why decisions by the German Federal Constitutional Court receives media coverage. 

The results show that the media is more likely to report on court cases if the journalists are familiar with court decisions (through previously held oral hearings or press releases which invite the media's attention), whereas news factors like influence and conflict does not exert substantial influence of the probability of media coverage. This implicates that courts possess tools which they can use to proactively influence media coverage.
