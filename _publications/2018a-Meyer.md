<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Research on the media coverage on decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court shows that a court decision’s newsworthiness, determined by specific case characteristics, influences the likelihood that a decision gets covered by the media. However, in the context of European constitutional courts, similar results do not exist. I argue that media coverage on court decisions can be understood as justice reporting, focused on the general public interest and operationalized by case characteristics which indicate the newsworthiness of decisions. Using the case of the German Federal Constitutional court I aim to explain why court decisions are featured in the German media, defined here as receiving media coverage in at least one newspaper article. Based on original data on 3,404 decisions and 9,436 newspaper articles between 2008 and 2018, I use a local text alignment measurement between court decisions and newspaper articles to identify media coverage. The results show that media coverage on the German court isn’t affected by declarations of unconstitutionality, while it is more likely when a decision was accompanied either with a press release, an oral hearing, a dissenting opinion, or with a combination of all three case characteristics. Because these decisional aspects are the FCC’s prerogative, these results demonstrate that the German constitutional court has the instruments to independently influence media coverage.</p>
