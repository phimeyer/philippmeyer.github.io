<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Several studies have analyzed the causes of media coverage on court decisions, connecting data on media coverage and court decision data. However, although several courts around the world publish press releases to attract attention and communicate with the public, none of these studies examine if media outlets use court press releases for news production – defined here as the degree to which the news media reproduces the content of court press releases. To establish a causal link between judiciary and the media, the study focuses on court decisions that are promoted with a press release and verifiably picked up by the media. It examines 423 newspaper articles published by two German daily newspapers (Die Süddeutsche and Die Welt) which have reported on 121 German Federal Constitutional Court cases between 2013 and 2017. Content reproduction is measured by the text-similarity between press releases and news articles. Results show that news media reproduces press releases when the underlying policy issue is complex, when the period between both documents is short and when the newspaper article cites a news agency report. I interpret these results based on news values research and recent discussions on open justice and reflect on the implications for judicial accountability.</p>
