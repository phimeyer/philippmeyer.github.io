<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Several judicial politics and political communication studies have analysed the causes of media coverage on court decisions, using media data which are linked to data on court behaviour. These studies investigate when the media reports on a court decision. However, although several high courts around the world actually promote their decisions through press releases in order to attract the media’s interest, none of these studies examine the influence of courts on the news content. In this article, I focus on true-positive cases – decisions promoted with a press release and covered by at least one newspaper article – to analyse when and why newspapers actually use court press releases to produce news content. Whether or not a press release was used by the media is measured by a text similarity approach.  Potential causes of court press releases usage are diverse and range from court behaviour to policy issues and media characteristics. Methodologically, I use OLS regression models with standard errors clustered by years. Results show, that newspaper use court press releases more likely when an oral hearing was held during adjudication (court behaviour), when the decision at stake deals with either with law, social, or governmental issues (policy issues), and when the time span between newspaper article and court decision is short and when the article is not an opinion piece (media characteristics).</p>
