<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
Several studies have analysed the causes of media coverage on court decisions, using media data that are linked to data on court behaviour. However, although several high courts around the world publish press releases in order to attract attention and communicate with the public, none of these studies examine whether press releases affect news content – defined here as the degree to which the news media reproduces the content of court press releases. This study examines true-positive cases – decisions promoted with a press release and covered by at least one newspaper article – and analyses when the content of court press releases is used to produce news content. This analysis is based on 121 decision-related press releases issued by the German Federal Constitutional Court and 423 newspaper articles published by two leading German daily newspaper (Die Süddeutsche and Die Welt) between 2013 and 2017. The degree of reproduction between newspaper articles and press releases is measured by computer-assisted content analysis like text similarity computations. Results show that news media reproduces court press releases when the underlying policy issue is complex, when the time span between the newspaper article and the press release is short and when the newspaper article echoes a news agency report. I interpret these results based on gatekeeping theories and recent discussions on open justice, and reflect on the implications for the judicial accountability.</p>
