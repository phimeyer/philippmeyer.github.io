<p><b>Abstract</b><br>
The concept of information dissemination describes the process of broadcasting messages to the public. Dissemination describes the preliminary stage of agenda-building in which information get subsidizes to the public but not further processed (Weaver and Choi, 2014). By focusing on legal information disseminated by courts, this papers asks the following research question: Which kind of information do courts disseminate? This paper will structure and decompose decision information disseminated by the German Federal Constitutional Court (GFCC). The general aim is to present a novel data set which covers all decisions made available on the official court website, decomposed into various decision characteristics (e.g. proceeding type, oral hearing, unanimous decisions) and decision content (e.g. unsuccessful claims, topic of the decision). The data set covers 6911 decisions decided between 1951 and June 2018.</p>
